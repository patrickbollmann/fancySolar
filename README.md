Fancy webinterface for old Kostal / Piko solar inverters

The Webinterface of old Piko / Kostal solar inverters is not very useful and very limited in features.

With this Project you are able to read and process data from the old Piko / Kostal solar inverters into a database.
Results are shown in a new fancy webinterface based on interactive graphs using plotly js. Also it is very easy to customise and add new charts based on the newly organized data.

Plotly JS: https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js
